                    <b>Synopsis:</b> The Kims - mother and father Chung-sook and
                    Ki-taek, and their young adult offspring, son Ki-woo and
                    daughter Ki-jung - are a poor family living in a shabby and
                    cramped half basement apartment in a busy lower working
                    class commercial district of Seoul. Without even knowing it,
                    they, especially Mr. and Mrs. Kim, literally smell of
                    poverty. Often as a collective, they perpetrate minor scams
                    to get by, and even when they have jobs, they do the minimum
                    work required. Ki-woo is the one who has dreams of getting
                    out of poverty by one day going to university. Despite not
                    having that university education, Ki-woo is chosen by his
                    university student friend Min, who is leaving to go to
                    school, to take over his tutoring job to Park Da-hye, who
                    Min plans to date once he returns to Seoul and she herself
                    is in university.
